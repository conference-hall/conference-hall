# Contributing

Contributions, issues and feature requests are very welcome.

If you want to contribute, you must read and accept our [Code of Conduct](./code-of-conduct.md).

## Guidelines

### General guidelines

- The `main` branch is where incoming new features are merged (the next coming release).
- The production branch is a snapshot of the latest stable release.
- All hotfix should be done in dedicated branch from the `production` branch.
- All new features / bugs should be done in a dedicated branch from the `main` branch.
- It's a very nice thing to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR. It's easier to review it. Then we will squash it before merging.

### Adding new features

Ideally you should talk about it on [Discussions](https://github.com/conference-hall/conference-hall/discussions) with other contributors or open a [suggestion issue](https://github.com/conference-hall/conference-hall/issues).

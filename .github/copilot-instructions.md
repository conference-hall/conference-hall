Write all TypeScript code using single quotes and 2-space indentation to maintain consistency across our codebase.

Our primary web framework is "React Router v7", and it’s served by an Express server, so structure any backend or routing suggestions accordingly.

We use Prisma as our ORM, so ensure that all database queries and models follow Prisma's syntax and conventions.

For asynchronous jobs, rely on BullMQ and use our custom abstraction layer to manage job queues and processing.

Components are styled using Tailwind CSS, so any styling suggestions should be compatible with Tailwind's utility-first approach.

Our tests are run with Vitest, so please structure all test-related code and examples to align with Vitest’s syntax and best practices.

All javascript and typescript file imports includes the file extensions (ex: import { Example } from './example.ts' ), use this syntax for the suggestions.

Prefer named exports over default exports, use this convention for the suggestions.
